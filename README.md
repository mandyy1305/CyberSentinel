A variety of malicious enemies like malware, trojans, and viruses emerge from the right side, imitating real-world cyber threats.

Defense Mechanisms:
Players deploy defense components such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and more to stop attacks before they reach the servers.

Interactive Education:
Hovering over components (both threats and defenses) displays detailed descriptions, providing educational insights into their purpose and behavior.
